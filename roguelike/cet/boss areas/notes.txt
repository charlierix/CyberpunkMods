play with the object spawner to see what it takes to define object

see if that has an export/import tool

also have some optional items that will appear once room's objectives have be met
    - treasure boxes
    - portal
        If they step through the portal, they will be taken to a random spawn point that's a reasonable distance from the next boss room
