Nekhraos

Zorlak nekhraos krenar
Drekul malenar fate
No lorak, no jenar, no lifar renar
Only khaos and hate

But in the miskar of nekhraos
A spark of litar pears
A voice of lovar, a hand of gracer
A promis to end the fears

The litar will overkom the nekhraos
And bring a new kreation
A world of pacer, a world of lifer
A glorious salvasion
