in cyberpunk 2077 lore, are there any words for dead spirits?


I’m not sure if there are any specific words for dead spirits in Cyberpunk 2077 lore, but I did find some references to ghosts and souls in the Cyberpunk universe. For example:

Ghosts are a type of artificial intelligence that are created from the digital copies of human minds. They are usually stored in soulkiller programs, which are designed to trap and destroy the consciousness of netrunners who hack into secure systems.

Souls are the essence of human beings that can be transferred, copied, or manipulated by various means. Some people believe that souls can be lost or corrupted by excessive cyberware or braindance addiction.

Soulkiller is a notorious program that was developed by Alt Cunningham, a legendary netrunner and former lover of Johnny Silverhand, a famous rockerboy and rebel leader. Soulkiller can capture and destroy the minds of anyone who encounters it in cyberspace. Alt was captured by Arasaka, a powerful megacorporation, and used to create a more advanced version of Soulkiller. Johnny tried to rescue her, but both of them were seemingly killed by the program. However, their digital ghosts survived and became influential figures in the net

Are there examples of rogue ai agents, or others that got soulkilled and are drifting around?


Yes, there are some examples of rogue AI agents or others that got soulkilled and are drifting around in Cyberpunk 2077 lore. For example:

Rogue Amendiares is a former mercenary and lover of Johnny Silverhand who became a powerful fixer in Night City. She is one of the few people who knows the truth about 
Johnny’s fate and Alt Cunningham’s location. She helps V and Johnny infiltrate Arasaka Tower in 2077 to find Alt and free Johnny’s soul.

Mr. Blue Eyes is a mysterious figure who appears to be behind some of the major events in Night City. He has pale blue eyes that glow in the dark, and he is rumored to be a rogue AI or a digital ghost of someone powerful. He hires V for a secret mission after the main story, and he seems to have connections to Arasaka, Militech, and the Voodoo Boys.

Bryce Mosley is a netrunner who was hired by NetWatch to hack into the Blackwall and find out what lies beyond it. He encountered a rogue AI that corrupted his mind and turned him into a puppet. He later attacked V and tried to kill them with a virus, but was stopped by Placide, the leader of the Voodoo Boys.

do the voodoo boys have their own network?


The Voodoo Boys do have their own network, but it’s not a conventional one. They are obsessed with exploring the other side of the Blackwall, where the rogue AIs and the old web are hidden. They use a secret network of servers and satellites to access the Blackwall and try to breach it. They also have a hidden base in the Grand Imperial Mall, where they perform rituals and experiments with cyberspace.

The Voodoo Boys are not a typical gang. They are more like a cult that worships the net and the mysteries beyond it. They are mostly composed of Haitian immigrants who fled their country after a series of disasters and conflicts. They have a strong sense of community and identity, and they use their skills as netrunners to protect their turf in Pacifica, a rundown district of Night City that is largely abandoned by the authorities.
