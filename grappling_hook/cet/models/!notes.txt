The files in this folder are just defining interface that the rest of the lua script conforms to

Lots of functionality will be written around these types, as well as database entries

So using c#, because it's easier to define types in that (also, the files won't be seen as lua
and try to be interpreted at runtime)

It's also easier to prototype the ui in wpf


NOTE: There is a post build event in the c# project that replaces these .cs files with its copy
