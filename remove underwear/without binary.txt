There's a much easier way of doing this. Without the need of any mod, only a hex editor. 
In your install folder go to archive/pc/content
Use Hex Editor and open the file: basegame_4_gamedata.archive
Do Search -> Replace KeywordReplace the word: 
this:		underwear
with this:	underwe_r


It should find 6 entries that got replaced. Save the edited file, start up the game, remove the clothes, and enjoyed the underwear bug fixed. You should see your character fully nude now.



I did the changes, but now the panties (female character) are still there, and they are like pink (from the default black).
Any ideas?


-- so probably want to wear pants before changing
